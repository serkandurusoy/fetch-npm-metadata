# Fetch NPM Metadata

This is a one off script to fetch package metadata

- description
- version release date
- latest version and its release date
- homepage or repository url

from NPM package repository.

It is used for populating missing information needed for part of an internal tech stack audit,
for which we compiled a list of direct third party dependencies of some of our software.
